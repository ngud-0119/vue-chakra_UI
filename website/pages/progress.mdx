## Import

<br />

```js
import { CProgress } from '@chakra-ui/vue'
```

## Usage

```vue live=true
<c-progress :value="80" />
```

### Progress with Stripe

You can add `hasStripe` prop to any progressbar to apply a stripe via a CSS
gradient over the progress barâ€™s background color.

```vue live=true
<c-progress has-stripe :value="59" />
```

### Progress sizes

There are two ways you can increase the height of the progressbar:

- You can add `size` prop to increase the height of the progressbar.
- You can also use the `height` prop to manually set a height.

```vue live=true
<c-stack :spacing="5">
  <c-progress color="vue" size="sm" :value="20" />
  <c-progress color="vue" size="md" :value="40" />
  <c-progress color="vue" size="lg" :value="50" />
  <c-progress color="vue" height="32px" :value="30" />
</c-stack>
```

### Progress color

You can add `color` prop to any progressbar to apply any color that exists in
the theme.

```vue live=true
<c-progress color="gray" has-stripe />
```

### Animated Progress

The striped gradient can also be animated. Just add `isAnimated` and `hasStripe`
prop to the progressbar to animate the stripes right to left via CSS3
animations.

```vue live=true
<c-progress has-stripe is-animated />
```

## Accessibility

- Progress has a `role` set to `progressbar` to denote that it's a progress.
- Progress has `aria-valuenow` set to the percentage completion value passed to
  the component, to ensure the progress percent is visible to screen readers.
