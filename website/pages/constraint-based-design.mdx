# Constraint Based Design

In order to help you create clean, consistent layouts, Chakra UI provides building blocks that take
advantage of [constraint-based design principles](https://react-ui.dev/core-concepts/constraints-based-design).

Chakra UI's design principles are built around 2 core concepts:

- Design tokens
- Space scales

## Design tokens

[Design tokens](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens) are named values that are
used in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing)
in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.

These constraints help you to create consistent, high quality user interfaces.

Chakra UI's theming system leverages design tokens for different style properties
like color, spacing, font sizes, font weights, opacity, radii, shadows, z-indices, border widths and breakpoints.

This allows us to create a system that enables us to style our applications in ways that can be scaled
across different scales. These include a typographic (`font-size`)
scale, a spacing scale for `margin` and `padding`, and a color object.

By default Chakra UI uses the [System UI Theme Specification](https://system-ui.com/theme/)

## Space Scales

Because Chakra UI uses styled system under the hood, it allows you to reliably create consistent
spacing of elements in your applications. The `space` key can directly be referenced by
`padding`, `margin`, `top`, `right`, `bottom` and `left` style properties.

By default, Chakra UI uses a comprehensive **4pt grid** as a single unit. So in order to apply a
padding of `32px`, you can use the value `32px / 4px = 8`. i.e. `padding: 8`

```jsx
export default {
  space: {
    px: '1px',
    '0': '0',
    '1': '0.25rem',
    '2': '0.5rem',
    '3': '0.75rem',
    '4': '1rem',
    '5': '1.25rem',
    '6': '1.5rem',
    '8': '2rem',
    '10': '2.5rem',
    '12': '3rem',
    '16': '4rem',
    '20': '5rem',
    '24': '6rem',
    '32': '8rem',
    '40': '10rem',
    '48': '12rem',
    '56': '14rem',
    '64': '16rem'
  }
}
```

Below are some examples of how to apply spacing values to Chakra components.

```html
<!-- Applies a padding of 4px -->
<c-box padding="1">
  Box
</c-box>

<!-- Applies a padding of 16px -->
<c-box padding="4">
  Box
</c-box>

<!-- Applies a padding of 32px -->
<c-box padding="8">
  Box
</c-box>
```

> Chakra UI's default space scale uses `rems` as the CSS unit which is relative to the default root HTML font size of 16px

## Theme

By default Chakra UI uses a theme object that you can extend and customize as you see fit for your application.
