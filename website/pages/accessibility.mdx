# Accessibility

Chakra UI is built from the ground up with accessibility in mind. We do the
heavy-lifting for you in order to allow you to focus on building your applications.

All authored components are compliant with the WAI-ARIA standards for authored components.

We've taken the time to write a summarized description of the accessibility support for
all authored components in @chakra-ui/vue. We called this document an accessibility report
and can be found in the `accessibility.md` file in the respective component's source directory.

You will also be able to find this file linked in the documentation pages of components that have
an accessibility report.
