# Popover

Popover is a non-modal dialog that floats around a trigger. It's used to display
contextual information to the user, and should be paired with a clickable
trigger element.

Popover is built on top of the [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/) library, and
composes the `Popper` component.

## Import

- `CPopover`: The wrapper that provides props, state, and context to it's
  children.
- `CPopoverTrigger`: Used to wrap the reference (or trigger) element.
- `CPopoverContent`: The popover itself.
- `CPopoverHeader`: The header of the popover.
- `CPopoverBody`: The body of the popover.
- `CPopoverArrow`: A visual arrow that points to the reference (or trigger).
- `CPopoverCloseButton`: Obviously, a button to close the popover.
