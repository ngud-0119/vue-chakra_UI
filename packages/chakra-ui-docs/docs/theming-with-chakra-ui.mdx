# Theming

By default, Chakra UI exposes a [**default theme object**](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui-vue/blob/master/packages/chakra-ui-theme/src/theme/index.js) that follows the [System UI Theme Specification](https://system-ui.com/theme/).

This object/theme specification provides a way to store your design system's style values (e.g. colors), design tokens and scales.

## Understanding Chakra's Theme Specification
Chakra UI's theme object is built around the idea of _scales_. 

Scales include values like a typographic scale (for your applications font styles), a spacing scale for margins and paddings, and a color scale for your application's colors.

The theme is defined as a single object that exports difference scale values.
